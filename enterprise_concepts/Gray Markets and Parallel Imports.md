"Parallel imports (or gray market goods) refer to branded goods that are imported into a market and sold there without the trademark owner's consent in that market."
- Goods manufactured by or under the licensing of the owner and so they are not counterfeit.
- Likely to "have been formulated or packaged for a particular jurisdiction and are imported into a different jurisdiction in contradiction to brand owner's intention"
	- As in the case of Sci-Hub? Or is Sci-Hub on the "black market" side?
- [Exhuastion of IP] rights refers to extent to which IP holder can control the distribution of branded goods
	- Once holder sells product to a jurisdiction, the rights holder must allow the resale of that product in that jurisdiction. Trademark rights covering the product have been "exhausted" by the first sale
	- Do publishers have a sort of world-wide exhaustion of those rights then? Couldn't someone like a subscriber then "resell" the papers for a low cost like 0$?
	- Perhaps covered by "International exhaustion" where the trademark has been put into the market anywhere in the world by the owner or with the owners consent.
