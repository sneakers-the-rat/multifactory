1.  Keep SSP members and interested parties aware of new developments in publishing
2.  Point to research reports and projects
3.  Interpret the significance of relevant research in a balanced way (or occasionally in a provocative way)
4.  Suggest areas that need more input by identifying gaps in knowledge
5.  Translate findings from related endeavors (publishing outside STM, online business, user trends)
6.  Attract the community of STM information experts interested in these things and give them a place to contribute
