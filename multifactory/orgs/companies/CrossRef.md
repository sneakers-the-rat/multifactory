## History
https://www.crossref.org/about/history/
With respect to Crossref’s formation, things really kicked off in 1999. A prototype project by [[Academic Press]], [[Wiley]], and the DOI-X project, created the technical foundations for reference linking based on centralized metadata and the assignment of [Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)](https://www.doi.org). The prototype system was demonstrated at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1999. Publishers quickly rallied around and in December 1999 a working group of 12 organizations met and decided to form Crossref as an independent, not-for-profit organization. Crossref was incorporated in January 2000 - as Publishers International Linking Association, Inc. (PILA). The Crossref system, the first collaborative reference linking system, went live in June 2000.

THE “WHAT NEXT, AND HOW” were worked out over the next three months through a series of meetings, the first held on November 8 at [[Wiley]]’s New York offices. The meeting opened with a general statement that the initiative was designed to provide “a service demanded by our users, which will benefit science,” and included reports from the Technology, Legal, and Publicity Working Groups. Governance and funding were addressed, with Wiley, [[Academic Press]], [[Elsevier]], [[Blackwell]], [[Springer]]-Verlag, and [[Springer]] Nature Publishing Group committing to provide startup loans; [[Wolters Kluwer]] Academic Publishers and The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. ([[IEEE]]) joined the funding group soon after.

On November 16, a press release announcing the imminent launch of the as-yet unnamed service was issued by the 12 participating publishers, in cooperation with the [[International DOI Foundation]]: [[AAAS]], Academic Press, [[AIP]], Association for Computing Machinery ([[ACM]]), Blackwell, Elsevier, IEEE, Kluwer Academic, Nature Publishing Group, [[Oxford University Press]], Springer-Verlag, and Wiley. The release included quotes from representatives of most of the publishers.

The Governance Task Force met at [[Wiley]]’s offices on November 29, establishing that the 12 original members would comprise the Board of Directors, that there would be a fivemember Executive Committee, and addressed various other issues, including the creation of a code of practices for member publishers. A second press release was issued on December 9, announcing the CrossRef name and the inclusion of four additional participants—The [[University of Chicago Press]], [[IOP Publishing]], [[World Scientific Publishing]], and [[Taylor & Francis]].
