A defense of a publisher-defined version of record.

## **The Centrality of the Version of Record**

What we can see then is what I would term the teleological and central nature of the version of record in organizing the scholarly record. As the version of record comes into being, it has the effect of fixing the earlier versions as predecessors to it. In addition, anything that comes after the version of record is defined relative to it. This centrality is reflected throughout the scholarly communications system in a number of ways.
