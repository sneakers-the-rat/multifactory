How does Article 17 DSM work?  
- The directive recognizes that OCSSPs are liable for the content they host and give access to the public (act of communication to the public).  
- 2 mechanisms  
	- Licensing mechanism:  
		- The OCSSP can obtain an authorization (eg license) for the use of a rightholderâ€™s content  uploaded by its users  
		- However, It is not always possible to have a license concluded with a platform for a variety of  reasons  
	- Liability mechanism:  
		- When there is no authorization, the starting point is that the OCSSP is presumed liable unless it  can demonstrate best effort  
		- One of the goals of article 17: protect and allow rightholders to determine whether, and under  which conditions their content is used  
		- Therefore a liability mechanism was needed when the content is uploaded by users on the  platform without the consent of the rightholder
