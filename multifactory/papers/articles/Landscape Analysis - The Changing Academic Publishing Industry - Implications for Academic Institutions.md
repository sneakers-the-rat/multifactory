Central Message:
> It is important to underscore upfront that we are not opposing the use of data and data analytics in academic institutions. This project is aimed at ensuring that academic institutions retain control over the use of data and data analytics, that the use of data and data analytic tools is consistent with the goals of the academic community and that academic institutions are properly equipped to deal with the risks and implications posed by the rising amount of data being collected, analyzed, and used. pp 8


# Summary Statement from Authors

*"Academic publishing is udnergoing a major transition as some of its leaders are moving from a content provision to a data analytics business"*

- Research assessment
- Productivity tools
- OLMS

In apparent effort to be fundamental to the conducting of end-to-end business of universities. Could:

>invisibly and strategecially influence, and perhaps exer control, over key university decisions (like) student assessment to research integrity to financial planning... (This) represents a potential multi-billion...(perhaps) multi-trillion (dollar market) when the value of intellectual property is factored in, but its capture and use could significantly reduce institutions and scholars' rights to their data and related intellectual property. pp 3


## The Academic Publishing Industry in 2018
### Background
"At first glance, academic publshing should have shared the traits of most [[Business-to-Business Model]] (B2B) media businesses after the transition to digital products and services:"
- Concentrated supply protected by scale economies in sales and distribution with high barriers to entry
- Pricing power driven by oligopolistic supply with inelastic demands
- Rising profitability

"Fault Lines appearing": Driven by media usage behavior (ie cable TV users "cutting the cord")
- Librarians are taking tougher stances when negotiating renewal of scholarly journal collections, more willing to let them expire
- Digital dissmenination has enabled piracy to play an increasing role in the form of 
[[Gray Markets and Parallel Imports]] as well as unlicensed downloads of digital copies

Response of industry:
- Legal action
- Lower prices or at least rate of price increases to reflect changing elasticity of demand
- New business models like hybrid journals that maintain subscriptions but accept Open Access Publications
- "Inclusive access" to textbooks

#### Transformation to data analytics companies: Elsevier, Pearson, Cengage

Build analytics on top of scientific content that can be monetized without abandoning traditional conent business
- Very large and profitable relative to toal size of business
- Without content they have a hard time to build credible data offerings
	- What makes a "credible" data offering? This sounds like a widely applicable thing in science generally at the level of different labs, companies, institutions, funding agencies, etc...


>Until now, these companies were – at worst – seen by institutions as an annoyance for selected communities within academia. Librarians complained about the cost of periodicals and talked about a “serials crisis”, but the impact on the overall budget of a university was well below half of a percentage point. Similarly, the high cost of textbooks was an issue for students, and in particular those coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, but scholarships and some forms of financial aid, as well as the used textbook market, tended to mitigate the problem. - pp 7

Shifting services into data analytics/monitoring signals a move to control core activities of academic institutions as well as generates legal and reputational risks for institutions too pending data governance, hacks, etc.

## Research
### Background - An Industry in Transition

To the authors, the moist obvious future direction for continued growth is to use the data they have access to and offer data analytics services.


#### [[Elsevier]]

The company bypasses academic librarians by attempting to deal with offices above them at least in academic institutions. Further, it lobbies extensively to extend copyrights in new ways. For some of their historical publishing practices, see [[Elsevier#Practices]].

In short, the authors state that there are little to no increases in operating costs that justify the price increases the company provides:

> The first part of the argument is surprising – if productivity at Elsevier does not rise, then management is not doing its job properly – and the second part of the argument is wrong – administration or IT staff does not rise just because more articles are published. In light of the financial pressure on academic library budgets, refusing to pass along some of the savings is strictly a commercial and business decision.

The services they invest in with these profits don't benefit the libraries that purchase them and so those who buy their services are effectively funding the benefits for customers other than themselves as well as Elsevier shareholders.
- One question here: We don't seem to mind much about this with respect to other kinds of business/services right? We use services from groups and those funds are used to fund other services of the organization even if it doesn't serve us better. Perhaps it's because we have literally no other choice with respect to publishers?

The authors state that increases in the number of articles published does not guarantee that the research is of any good quality. Further, that many of the articles or journals that are added have little to no readership nor subscribers.
- Is this necessarily a bad thing? I suppose in terms of forcing libraries to fund journals they would never read/subscribe to it is a bad thing. Similar to how if you're buying cable (shivers) you'll pay for a ton of channels you won't want to watch. But *someone* want's to watch some of it right? Is it better if those avenues for publication did not exist? If a work is published but nobody is there to read it, does it really exist? I suppose high quality work would be published in better known journals by default maybe...
- Further, there's no assurance of quality of work based on publication location either nor author/institution/lab. This seems like a clear avenue of attack against publishers, but doesn't seem to have the sharpest of teeth... Even if it's of course good to ensure that the probability of low quality research is as low as possible, simply reducing the number of published papers doesn't seem to make that necessarily most likely.
