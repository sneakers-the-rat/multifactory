[[Article Sharing Framework - Facilitating Scholarly Sharing through Metadata]]

"In order to address this challenge, a team under the [[STM Association]]’s, [STEC Committee](https://www.stm-assoc.org/standards-technology/), developed the [Article Sharing Framework](https://www.stm-assoc.org/asf/). The Framework gives scholarly publishers a mechanism to provide SCNs — in machine-actionable form — information about an article’s PDF’s identity and the respective publisher’s sharing policies. This enables SCNs to use the information to determine in an automated way, and in real-time, whether the publisher’s content may be shared."
