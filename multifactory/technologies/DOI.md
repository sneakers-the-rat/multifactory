"A prototype project by [[Academic Press]] [[Wiley]] and the [[DOI-X]] project"

# DOI history

https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/1_Introduction.html#1.2
The DOI system originated in a joint initiative of three trade associations in the publishing industry ([[IPA]] International Publishers Association; International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers [[STM Association]]; Association of American Publishers [[AAP]]). Although originating in text publishing, the DOI was conceived as a generic framework for managing identification of content over digital networks, recognising the trend towards digital convergence and multimedia availability. The system was announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair 1997. The International DOI® Foundation ([[International DOI Foundation]] [[International DOI Foundation]]) was created to develop and manage the DOI system, also in 1997.

## From [[CrossRef]]'s History

At the Board meeting of the [[STM Association]], held the  
afternoon of Monday, October 11, before the fair’s Wednesday  
opening, discussion focused on an emerging U.S. National  
Library of Medicine ([[NLM]]) initiative called E-Biomed (later  
[[PubMed]] Central) that had been proposed by Harold Varmus of  
the National Institutes of Health in the spring of 1999. Varmus  
envisioned a digital archive of journals, accessible free of charge  
and with the added value of reference linking. “Our consensus  
was that publishers should be the ones doing the linking,” said  
[[Bob Campbell]], who chaired the meeting. “Since we were ‘higher  
up the stream,’ so to speak, we should be able to link our articles  
ahead of the NLM as part of the process of producing them.

[[Stefan von Holtzbrinck]] then set the ball rolling by offering to link  
Nature publications with anyone else’s. We decided to issue an  
announcement of a broad STM reference linking initiative. It was,  
of course, a strategic move only, since we had neither plan nor  
prototype.”

[[Pieter Bolman]]  and [[Eric Swanson]]  chose to seize the moment, and called an ad hoc meeting the following evening, Tuesday, October 12, to announce their venture and assemble a coalition of publishers to launch it. Also present at the meeting were Campbell, [[Derk Haank]] of [[Elsevier]], [[Stefan von Holtzbrinck]], [[Tim Ingoldsby]] and [[Marc Brodsky]] of [[AIP]], [[Arnoud de Kemp]], [[Ken Metzner]], [[Ed Pentz]], [[Howard Ratner]], and [[Craig Van Dyck]]. Although there was some apprehension in the air that one faction or another might seek to sway the outcome, a collegial spirit of collaboration prevailed, with the central theme described by Bolman as, “What next, and how?” In the end, the participants in the meeting agreed to join the venture, with a number prepared to provide startup loans.

THE “WHAT NEXT, AND HOW” were worked out over the next three months through a series of meetings, the first held on November 8 at [[Wiley]]’s New York offices. The meeting opened with a general statement that the initiative was designed to provide “a service demanded by our users, which will benefit science,” and included reports from the Technology, Legal, and Publicity Working Groups. Governance and funding were addressed, with Wiley, [[Academic Press]], [[Elsevier]], [[Blackwell]], [[Springer]]-Verlag, and [[Springer]] Nature Publishing Group committing to provide startup loans; [[Wolters Kluwer]] Academic Publishers and The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. ([[IEEE]]) joined the funding group soon after.

On November 16, a press release announcing the imminent launch of the as-yet unnamed service was issued by the 12 participating publishers, in cooperation with the [[International DOI Foundation]]: [[AAAS]], Academic Press, [[AIP]], Association for Computing Machinery ([[ACM]]), Blackwell, Elsevier, IEEE, Kluwer Academic, Nature Publishing Group, [[Oxford University Press]], Springer-Verlag, and Wiley. The release included quotes from representatives of most of the publishers.
